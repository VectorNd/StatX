## üìã Features  

### **Frontend**  
- Built with **React**.  
- **Features:**  
  - User-friendly interface with responsive design powered by RSUITE and custom CSS.  
  - State management with React‚Äôs `useState`, `useEffect`, and Context API.  
  - Data visualization with interactive graphs and tables for real-time metrics.  

### **Backend**  
- Built with **Node.js** and **Express**, containerized with Docker.  
- **Features:**  
  - Scalable REST API for authentication, data fetching, and real-time calculations.  
  - **Redis** caching for lightning-fast responses.  
  - **MongoDB Atlas** for scalable and secure data storage (sharded for horizontal scaling).  
  - Authentication via **Google** and **GitHub OAuth**, with JWT tokens and **2FA (Speakeasy)**.  

### **Real-Time Workflow**  
1. **Login:** Users authenticate via Google or GitHub (2FA optional).  
2. **Search:** Enter a company name or code.  
3. **Compute:** Backend processes metrics like stock prices, market share, and diversity in real time.  
4. **Visualize:** Results are displayed on interactive graphs, with history for comparisons.
